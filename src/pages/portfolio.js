          What I&apos;ve Done
        </h1>
        <p>
          As a designer with a programming background, I became a front-end
          developer and have developed interests in UI/UX design, web
          development and visual analytics. For the past few years, I&apos;ve
          worked on numerous web applications mainly as a UI/UX designer and
          front-end developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic career has also shaped my interest in research-focused
          projects mostly in the scope of visual analytics and personal
          informatics.
        </p>
        <p>Below are some of my favourite projects that I&apos;ve worked on.</p>
