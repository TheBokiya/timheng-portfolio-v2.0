          <p>
            In a team of three people, we were tasked to perform a heuristic
            evaluation to find usability problems in Science World&apos;s
            website. We started off this project by coming up with a list of
            user&apos;s goals for the website such as checking out the schedule,
            buying tickets and booking a field trip etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we had all the goals listed out, we then proceeded to task
            analysis by analyzing how those goals can be completed.
            Individually, we went through the tasks while using the websites to
            find usability problems. We gathered all the usability problems
            found and assessed the severity of the problems. Last but not least,
            we wrote a heuristic evaluation report discussing our findings and
            suggested improvements that we believe we help solving those
            usability problems. The report was later submitted to Science World.
