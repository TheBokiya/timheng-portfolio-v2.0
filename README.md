# My Personal Portfolio v2

This personal portfolio was built from scratch using Gatsby.

## Why built another portfolio site?

I could use a project to learn about JSX and Gatsby.

## Setup

Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:TheBokiya/timheng-portfolio-v2.0.git
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Run the project

Before you can run the project, make sure you have Gatsby CLI installed.

Install Gatsby CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Start the development server:

```bash
$ gatsby develop
```
